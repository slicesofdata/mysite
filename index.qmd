### **Me**

*Father. Husband. Gardener. Climber. Fermentation Enthusiast.*

I love research, data, and trying to understand the underlying influences of events. I am an enthusiast of efficiency, automation, and work flow. I’ve been called contrarian and told I think too much, yet I believe challenging the status quo moves us forward. I enjoy teaching others to do the same.

*"Rivalry of scholars advances wisdom."*
– Hebrew Proverb

### **Teaching**

I have been a professor at Claremont McKenna College since 2005 and have taught courses on statistics, research methods, memory, cognition, and decision making. I’d like to develop a course related to Data Science using Python and R if time permits. I also offer a course on memory at Claremont Graduate School. I manage my Human Learning and Memory Lab at CMC.
