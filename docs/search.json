    "text": "In a nutshell\nI am research scientist and Associate Professor with a specialization in the cognitive mechanisms underlying memory, attention, and decision making.\nI focus primarily on studying the variables that influence how people remember (or forget) to fulfill everyday intentions at the home, at school, or in the workplace.\nSome other research has focused on understanding whether financial gains or losses can influence memory for carrying out such tasks, which may have implications for workplace performance and bonus structures. I also study how people remember the origin of information, which plays a role in distinguishing between reality and imagination as well as attributing ideas to team members accurately."
