## **What we do**

In the Data Visualization lab, our research focuses on understanding how people perceive, attend to, interpret, remember, and make decisions from data visualizations. In particular, we are interested in understanding the cognitive constraints, limitations, and biases associated with the daily task of understanding data through visualizations.
